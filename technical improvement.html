    <em><h3>
      âž© Now-a-days, We generally worry about girls safety when they visit alone
to anywhere and the case when they visit in night through train, any means
of communication. I personally have seen some miscreant or rascal use to
tease or have their bad eyes on girls when they are travelling alone, which
is mort imbarrassing things for a girl to handle about.<br>
So, I personally want to develop an APP (approved by government) where
the same have to upload their all details or simply their AADHAR
identity(which help to reduce misuse of APP) which will access location of
that particular person and that all will connected to the most Local POLICE
of the same AREA and the user just have to click on that one particular
option given in APP<br>
& the soon POLICE or PCR reached their to handled situation.<br>
(I am more exploring & thinking about the successful implementation).</em></h3>
